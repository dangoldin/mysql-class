Introduction to MySQL
=====================

This is the series of notes prepared for the [MySQL class](http://www.c4q.nyc/introtomysql/) taught at [Coalition for Queens](http://www.c4q.nyc/) during October 2014. The goal is to provide an interactive overview of MySQL and get to writing more and more complicated queries.

### [Getting Started]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting_started)

- A quick guide on how to install MySQL and a MySQL client to make querying easy

### [Session I]({{ site.baseurl }}/session1/mysql-class-lecture-1.pdf)

- [Notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/session1/mysql-class-lecture-1.pdf), [Exercises]({{ site.baseurl }}/session1/exercises1), [Solutions]({{ site.baseurl }}/session1/solutions1)
- Overview of MySQL and relational databases. What are they? How are they used? What are the alternatives?
- Provide a quick overview of the normal forms and what they mean. What impact does it have when they’re violated and go over what well designed databases have.
- Introduce the dataset we will be working with. This will mostly likely be a dataset I’ll pull from some of my side projects that will hopefully be relevant. Currently, I’m thinking of using a database containing some fantasy football data that I’ve scraped.
- Make sure everyone has MySQL installed or can get it installed.
- Introduce the SELECT query.
- Introduce simple aggregate functions.

### [Session II]({{ site.baseurl }}/session2/mysql-class-lecture-2.pdf)
