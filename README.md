MySQL Class
===========

I'll be teaching a MySQL class for Coalition 4 Queens and am using this repo to collect my notes and assets. Feel free to follow along and let me know if you have any questions since I will most likely need to address them during the class.

## Session I

Overview of MySQL and relational databases. What are they? How are they used? What are the alternatives?
Provide a quick overview of the normal forms and what they mean. What impact does it have when they’re violated and go over what well designed databases have.
Introduce the dataset we will be working with. This will mostly likely be a dataset I’ll pull from some of my side projects that will hopefully be relevant. Currently, I’m thinking of using a database containing some fantasy football data that I’ve scraped.
Make sure everyone has MySQL installed or can get it installed.

## Session II

Revist the dataset we’re working with and explain the relationships between the various tables and columns.
Go over the basic syntax of a query: SELECT, FROM, and WHERE.
Go over the basic INSERT statement.

## Session III

Review the basic syntax of a query and introduce the JOIN operations. Use joins to answer some simple questions from our dataset.
Introduce the GROUP BY functionality and the ways it can be used to summarize data. Use this in conjunction with joins to explore our dataset.
Develop some complicated and slow queries and introduce the idea of INDICES so everyone is aware of why they are useful.

## Session IV

Go over table creation and have the students come up with some interesting aggregate tables.
Provide a quick overview of how to diagnose a query for performance and how to test a query to make sure it was written correctly.
Discuss the various system tables (information_schema schema) and the various system commands that can be used to get a better understanding of MySQL
