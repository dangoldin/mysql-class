This site contains the notes for the [Introduction to MySQL](http://www.c4q.nyc/introtomysql/) class that was hosted by Coalation for Queens in October 2014. It was taught by [Dan Goldin](http://dangoldin.com) with a ton of help from the following people:

- Greg Gunderson
- Dan Vingo
- Alex Samuel
