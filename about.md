This site contains the notes for the [Introduction to MySQL](http://www.c4q.nyc/introtomysql/) class that was taught at [Coalation for Queens](http://www.c4q.nyc) in October 2014. It was taught by [Dan Goldin](http://dangoldin.com) with a ton of help from the following people:

- Greg Gunderson
- Dan Vingo
- Alex Samuel

This wonderful Jekyll theme was crafted with <3 by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com)
